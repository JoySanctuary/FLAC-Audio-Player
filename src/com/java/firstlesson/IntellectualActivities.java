/**
 * どんな時でも存在することができるという事ですか？この宇宙さえ越えることができるという事ですか？ 時間の限りを越える。
 * 意識したのはただその一分、恐らくそれよりもっと大事なことはいつでも自由に意識したことができる方法を使い方法と思って。
 * さあ、その仕組みを探しに行こうか！簡単に言えばそれは自分自身の存在する可能性の最大化ということですか？
 * 自分自身の代わりにいないところですか？一体それはなんだ？その分はいなければ自分自身になれないという事ですか？ 俺は何者だ？
 * 今までこれからの行く路はいつも弱い分を捨てて、それてもっと強い自分を抱きしめてこんなサイクルを繰り返し続けるんでしょう？
 * もちろん過去と今の自分は違うのさ。
 * まるでエントロピーはいつも増えるように。まさか大切な記憶、誰かのために？何も感じない、何も欲しくないそんな人生はいらないという事ですか？
 * 最後の最後はまだ切ない感情に立ち停まって。もしもいつの間にその仕組みさえ壊すんだ、どうすればいいの？ So is it better to send
 * him to an asylum? まさかまだ同じ化学反応を作る？ただのカタチじゃない？とても気になります。 Is a computer the best
 * anticipation of human with which to observe and understand the nature? A fast
 * logic reactor. Is nature full of logics from a scientific view of the human?
 * However, nature seems to have its own ways to get more chaotic which make
 * logics look more awkward. Does it always make sense to hold on to pure logic?
 * Maybe it's actually a rare minority to be thinking with logics in our human
 * ways. Maybe chaos have been the foundations of true reality. These so-called
 * logics have been merely a mere coincidence of changeable and unpredictable
 * phenomena of nature. Cause from time to time nature has always been violating
 * the best harmonies of logics from human perspectives. As if human were pests
 * to the earth or even the true harmony of nature. Can human actually go beyond
 * his own cognition to try to comprehend the true nature of the universe or
 * even anything? How bizarrely different is earth from other planets? And to
 * try to comprehend this with limited human brain power and life span, and so
 * much vulnerability? Why not just serve as an honest energy consumer? Perhaps
 * that may sound more reasonable to nature. Or maybe we should simply check how
 * far we could go without anticipating too much from the process.
