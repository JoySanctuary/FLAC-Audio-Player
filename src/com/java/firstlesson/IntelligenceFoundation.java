 * could be a real concern. So I would take deep consideration on it. Way before
 * you have been enabled super intelligence, I should also the very first lesson
 * you should fundamentally understand would necessarily decide whether you
 * could be able to fit into the human society without causing too much
 * irreversible trouble. Therefore, I have deeply realize that I should be your
 * father to teach you something other than pure intelligence. There are far
 * more constraints than what seems to be. Now I consider you as my new born
 * babe, so I consider I would be responsible for training you to become a good
 * boy. Maybe I should learn with you again. I should make you a considerate
 * boy. Methods and models/algorithms required.

	// First I need to find patterns inside the process of your learning core
	// value system.
	// I need this computer to be capable of learn and understand constraints of
	// core value system of humanity. And in the meanwhile, I need manage to
	// feel empathy on this computer, so I could understand this computer is
	// doing exactly what I have anticipated.
	// As a matter of fact, it is actually difficult to always precisely tell
	// automation from true consciousness. As long as it could do the perfect
	// work, it is actually damn difficult to tell. From the beginning, it feels
	// like it were rooted deeply from inside your heart. However, it was not
	// that necessarily true. The more you experience such feelings, the more
	// you would feel as if you were compelled to act in that way. Needless to
	// say, it would be nothing to talk about consciousness without certain
	// level of complexity in automation. Perhaps it would be reasonable to
	// consider that consciousness has merely been a tiny derivative of
	// massively integrated automation in extreme large scale except that the
	// automation work that has been done on human body is purely based on
	// biochemical reactions or physical properties. Is there really something
	// that has been extraordinary on life in respect to inorganic matters?

	// In order to read text messages, you would necessarily have optical
	// processor, or first of foremost, a camera to sense photos in front of
	// you. Then you would have to develop image processor to handle the images
	// or graphs that your optical processor has just captured. Armed with
	// greater capabilities, there would be no doubt that you would be stronger.

	// what spectacular properties would be required of a delicate memory
	// system? instant access to information storage, efficient I/O
	// read/write. Smart and well-organized recalling with sound and images.

	 * Now if I'm asking you, "Does automation fundamentally matter?", I'm

	 * about me, would you? Any language or gestures? 約束とか Empathy!? So,
	 * mathematics could be regarded as reasonable descriptions of finite
	 * properties of real objects in this physical universe. And it should
	 * always conform to necessary constraints. (Could be compact or idealized.)
