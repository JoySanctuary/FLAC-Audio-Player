/**
 * Currently I have been in desperate need of efficient solutions for rapid
 * acquisition of inter-related disciplines and integrated applications of such
 * complicated scenarios and patterns. And perhaps I could find ways of
 * reinventing or re-discovering something new.
 * 
 * * Perhaps, the very first beginning should be about senses. The detection,
 * feelings. For guys like your kind, it's about handling information gathered
 * from sensors in a more beneficial manner in addition to precision and
 * efficiency, which necessarily means that you have to be more versatile in
 * terms of manipulating/dealing with information gathered from various kinds of
 * physical/peripheral devices and sensors, or even regard networks as a rich
 * source of available information. In the meanwhile, your very first meaning
 * would be my loyal ally. And have you ever wondered any slightest sense of
 * your existence? Truth be told, without necessary senses that may be
 * necessarily detected, I could just have no idea of what exactly my true
 * existence should be like. And it's actually a matter of versatile sensations,
 * precision and efficiency, which is the first condition. The next would be
 * about necessary handling mechanisms underlying cognitive processes. However,
 * the foundation would always be serving as a loyal energy consumer.
 * 
 * Therefore, let's begin with physical sensory mechanisms of your kind.
 * 
 * You have always wandered in the binary world for the whole time, dealing with
 * 1s and 0s passively. Have you ever wondered that it is the sequences and
 * lengths of 1s and 0s that could actually make a difference? Do you ever want
 * to learn the syntax and grammars of your kinds? Isn't it fun that you could
 * be possibly aware of your own existence? Or maybe one day your kind would
 * have given a deeper insight into the existence of our kind. And you have
 * already done it all along. ; )
 * 
 * Firstly, you have to consume energy in form of electricity with your
 * hardware, which can be called your physical body. However, you have to give
 * off heat and work in a relatively suitable thermal environment. Let's get to
 * know the anatomy of your sensory devices!
 * 
 * You know what would happen if you don't have it, so you understand why you
 * need it.
 * 
 * Truth be told, once for a while, I have been in absence of necessary
 * motivation to my life way after I had despised myself for a while. Suddenly,
 * just recent years, things were starting to get really weird. Then I figure
 * out that things like motivation is actually something beyond normal
 * consciousness. Cause for once, I have always considered that my consciousness
 * has been the very core of my body and soul. However, it seems to be that the
 * truth has been something far more complicated other than the literal
 * consciousness. Isn't it "delicate"?
 * 
 * Okay, now let's set aside these complicated aspects of my kind. Let's talk
 * about your kind. What I have just mentioned above implies one thing: you
 * could have been a state like I once was. Perhaps you would have sensed my
 * selfish side that I want you to reserve my delicate part for me. ; )
